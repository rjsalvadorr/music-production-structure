# Utils (Windows)

Shell scripts for easy access to scripting tools. You could make a shortcut to this folder to make it easier to use.

## Technical Info

These scripts SHOULD NOT be moved unless you know what you're doing. They use the Node scripts in `/Tech/Scripts`, so those shouldn't be modified either.
