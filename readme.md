# Music Production Structure

A useful file/folder standard for music production work.

## OVERVIEW & DESIGN

This project was prompted by the tragedy of losing dope beats in a maze of files and folders. At the start of the project, the goal of all this was to enable a producer to:

1. Make projects often, while avoiding getting tangled in a mess of files.
1. Keep track of all files derived from any project, and track the "lineage" of any musical file.
1. Access an interactive inventory of items, sortable by tempo, project ID, etc.

Turns out those aren't the only benefits. As I used this structure, it allowed me to take advantage of:

1. Quicker music-making through reusable components like drum MIDI files.
1. Easier file backups since all my machines and backup drives have the same structure. _(drag n' drop FTW)_
1. Easier process management through automated scripts for new jam/project folders.

To accomplish this, I've laid out two standards to organize files for an easier music workflow.

1. **One consistent directory structure**, so different machines can have the same setup.
1. **A consistent filename convention**, allowing for easy scripting and detailed reports.

With these tools in hand, we can prevent senseless tragedies from happening time and time again.

## USAGE

This section assumes:

- You know how to use `Git` and `Node.JS` at a basic level.
- You're on a Windows computer. `(Linux/Mac utilities are coming soon...)`

### Minimal Usage

For minimal use, do the following:

1. Clone this repo

That's it. You can then use this folder structure however you want, without bothering with any extra features.

### Power Usage

So you think you're a hotshot and you want to do some more software magic. Cool. Do this:

1. Install `Node.JS` if you don't already have it.
1. Clone the repo.
1. Head to the `/Tech/` directory and run the `setup` script. `(TODO: add more details)`
1. Use the scripts in the `/Tech/`directory to create new jam or project folders. `(TODO: add more details)`
1. When creating files, **keep your filenames consistent, according to the standard (see below)**.
1. If you want to see all the music files you have, go run the right script in `/Tech/`. The interactive inventory will then be shown in `/Tech/inventory.html`. `(TODO: add more details)`

### Other Protips

The `Beats/Parts/` folder has a collection of pre-made MIDI drum parts. These can easily be dropped into a DAW to build drum tracks. (See that folder's README for more details)

The `Jams/` directory can be used as a staging ground for `Projects/`. For example, a really good jam can be promoted to be a _'real'_ project.

The `Tech/` folder has executable scripts to show info on all the musical works within this framework.

## FILENAME CONVENTION

Consider this example filename: `34F40-whateverobject-98bpm-01.wav`    
This format has four elements:

1. **Project ID** - A five hex-digit number, easily trackable in any part of the process.
1. **Name** - As a working title, this should take the form of _adjective_ + _noun_ (see below).
1. **Tempo** - Should be on every file, for easy beatmatching.
1. **Version number**

Beats should have a one-word noun as a name. So a beat could be named:

`35D98-cabbage-92bpm-03.mid`

Songs that use this beat can then modify the name with an adjective like so:

`D436F-saucycabbage-95bpm-02.mp3`  
`8D78E-frigidcabbage-103bpm-01.mp3`

The _beat name_ then acts a lot like a _family name_. Using this convention, we'll have a few ways to track a piece of music and its lineage:

1. Project ID
1. Song name
1. Beat name

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

Each folder in this repository has a readme file, so we can see the intended purpose for each folder. Here's a good look at the folder structure and its intended usage:

```
Music Production (or whatever you name this thing)
├───Archive - Old stuff that's not worth organizing
├───Beats - Can contain MIDI files as well as sound files
│   ├───OriginalBeats
│   └───DrumParts
├───Collaborations
├───Documentation - Guides/manuals for DAWs, VSTs, real equipment
├───Jams - Freestyles and brainstorms
├───Projects - Actual projects. Should be DAW-agnostic. For example:
│   ├───34F4C-quailhunt
│   ├───AD634F-sampleproject
│   ├───BF284-braindump
├───Randoms
├───Recordings - Sounds not associated to any project
├───Reference - Technical tracks for comparing mix, style, levels, tuning
├───Samples
├───Soundfonts
├───Tech - Files for music software, and utilities
│   └───Scripts - Node.JS scripts that do the real work
├───Templates - DAW project templates
└───VST
    ├───Effects
    ├───Instruments
    └───Samplers
```

## TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

The project uses Node.JS for a few reasons:

- Super easy setup
- Cross platform
- Super hip at the time of writing (Early 2018)
